        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p style="width: 1000px;">Hi! My name is Ashwin Jain, a Nashville native pursuing a BS in Computer Science + Economics at the University of Illinois is Urbana-Champaign. Growing up, I participated in many sports, including football, basketball, and wrestling. In high school, I took a break from sports to join the debate and mock trial teams. I’ve taken guitar and piano lessons for nearly 10 years and recently translated those skills to DJing, where I perform at various venues in Champaign.

        </p>
        <p style="width: 1000px">I started coding when I was in 3rd  grade, after stumbling across a YouTube video about Python. It took me the whole video to realize the video was not about snakes, but rather, computers. Nonetheless, I was fascinated and taught me self much of what I know about software engineering today.</p>

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p style="width: 1000px;">Welcome to the projects page! Here, you can take a look at all the projects I've worked on. Each of them are different, ranging from front end web apps, to mobile applications, to raw C++ projets. A link to each project's github is provided along with a short demo video.</p>
        <h4>Personal Website</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px;">This is the first front end project I worked on: my personal website. I decided to work on this project because I needed a place to showcase all of my work. I decided to buld it from scratch instead of using website builders to practice my front end development skills and also to make it unique to me.</p>
