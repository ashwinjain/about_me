        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          Hi! My name is Ashwin Jain, a Nashville native pursuing a BS in
          Computer Science + Economics at the University of Illinois is
          Urbana-Champaign. Growing up, I participated in many sports, including
          football, basketball, and wrestling. But in high school, I
          transitioned from sports to join the debate and mock trial teams.
          Furthermore, I've been taking guitar and piano lessons for nearly 10
          years and recently translated those skills to DJing, where I perform
          at various venues in Champaign.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          I started coding when I was in 3rd grade, after stumbling across a
          YouTube video about Python. It took me the whole video to realize the
          video was not about snakes, but rather, computers. Nonetheless, I was
          fascinated and taught me self much of what I know about software
          engineering today.

      <div id="projects" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          Welcome to the projects page! Here, you can take a look at all the
          projects I've worked on. Each of them are different, ranging from
          front end web apps, to mobile applications, to raw C++ projets. A link
          to each project's github is provided along with a short demo video.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Website</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          This is the first front end project I worked on: my personal website.
          I decided to work on this project because I needed a place to showcase
          all of my work. I decided to buld it from scratch instead of using
          website builders to practice my front end development skills and also
          to make it unique to me. A link to the code is provided here:
          <a href="https://github.com/ashwinjain/ashwinjain.github.io"

        </p>

        <h4>Linux Shell Program</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          In this program, I wrote a shell that could execute all standard linux
          commands. Additionally, the shell supported extra commands that
          allowed users to execute previous commands from the current session,
          as well as run a file of commands as well. This was a class project,
          so the code is not publically available, but this is a link to a
          demonstration.
          <a href="https://youtu.be/OTnsBRzqVMg">Shell Demo</a>
        </p>

        <h4>UIUC Gym App</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          This was a group project that I worked on with 3 of my friends. We
          developed a cross-platform mobile app that can track the current usage
          of machines at the UIUC gym. Students can spend a lot of time just
          waiting for a machine, so tracking which ones are in use or not can
          help users be more efficient at the gym.
        </p>

        <h4>Bellabeat Case Study</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          This is this capstone project for Google's Data Analytics certificate.
          Although its completion is not required for completion of the course,
          I decided to do it, as it is great practice for potential projects I
          would be required to do at a job. This case study analyzed data from
          around 30 FitBit users and used that data to inform Bellabeat on
          future marketing decisions. This is a link to the case study:

        </p>

        <h4>Poker</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          This is an online poker website I developed where users can join this
          website to play poker with other people. This is the first project I
          worked on that integrates both the frontend and the backend while
          utilizing tools, such as Socket.io, to enable client-server
          communications amoung a group of devices connected via internet. Note:
          This project is incomplete. There is still backend java integration
          that needs to be done that can determine whose hand is better. I plan
          on using Vaadin for this, as it allows for seemless frontend and
          backend integration with Java. As of now, the website allows for
          endless game play, however no money is being moved around as the
          algorithm I used to determine the best hand has not yet been
          integrated. A youtube link to view current progress of the website is
          provided here:
          <a href="https://youtu.be/EediwpJfdsY">Poker Website Demo</a>

        <h4>Taco Bell Path</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          This is a project I worked on with a few of my friends for our CS
          225(Data Structures) final project. The goal of this project was to
          find the shortest route from Champaign, IL to Union Station in Chicago
          that went through the most number of Taco Bells. We used a graph
          structure to store the data, and Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the
          shortest path. Albeit a silly project, it was the first time I worked
          in a group to accomolish a common objective. I learned a ton about
          peer programming, version control, and the importance of testing. My
          contribution included web scraping to aggregate a list of all Taco
          Bells and their addresses in Illinois into a csv file format.
          Additionally, I wrote test cases for our Dijkstra's algorithm
          implementation. The code is available on github here:

        <h3>Credentials</h3>
        <h4>Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          This certification was offered by Google and having completed all 8
          courses, I am professionally certified in Data Analytics. I learned
          many useful tools to analyze data, such as excel forumlas and
          functions, SQL commands, R Markdown; and visualization tools, such as
          Tableu. I utilized these new skills to analyze FitBit data for
          Bellabeat, and my findings are showcased on the Projects page. A link
          to the credential ID is linked here:

        <h4>Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate</h4>
        <p style="width: 1000px">
          This certification is offered by Google and is a continuation of thier
          intro data analytics course. I have completed 3 of the 8 courses, and
          am on track to complete the rest of the course by Novemeber. This
          course focuses more on data science and teaches the fundamentals of
          machine learning in Python.
